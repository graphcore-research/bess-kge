    "BESS-KGE (`besskge`) is a PyTorch library for knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models on IPUs implementing the distribution framework [BESS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12281), with embedding tables stored in the IPU SRAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to show how to use FP16 weights to reduce memory requirements for KGE models and speed up computations. This is especially important when dealing with knowledge graphs with a large number of entities, whose embeddings - if stored in FP32 - would require too many IPUs.\n",

Instead of sampling negative entities on a triple basis, we sample them on a shard-pair basis. In this case, each pair of devices will exchange 32 negative entities in both directions (while, if using `flat_negative_format=False`, this number would need to be a multiple of the shard batch size - see for instance the shape of `negative` in the [KGE Training and Inference on OGBL-BioKG](1_biokg_training_inference.ipynb) notebook).

Just set `corruption_scheme=\"ht\"` when creating the `TripleBasedShardedNegativeSampler` object and `duplicate_batch=True` in the `RigidShardedBatchSampler` and re-run the last three code cells. If this is the aim, however, you might want to corrupt both heads and tails already during training. You can do this by changing the corruption scheme of `RandomShardedNegativeSampler` accordingly before [starting training](#Interleaved-training-and-validation-(vs-all))."
